# Introduction
This repository contains a set of code samples on how to use .NET performance type System and the C# Language to implement performant code.

# Dataset
The dataset consists on a 1M records csv file generated from BlackFridayPRoductsFileGenerator project 

# Measures
All the measures were executed with BenchmarkNET 

# Projects

## BlackFridayProductsFileGenerator 

This file generates an 1M records  into a csv file to be used by the PerformantFileReader Project

## PerformantFileReader

This project contains a set of implementations to read a csv file and process all the records and the Benchmark code.

## PerformancePatterns

This repository contains examples about some of the patterns presented in https://prodotnetmemory.com/slides/PerformancePatterns/
